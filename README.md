<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is the project that has been done for the Software Engineering subject of the Computer Engineering degree at the University of Barcelona. This project has been developed following the different methodologies seen in class.


This website is based on the sale of books online in which users can search among a large number of books and can buy those they like the most. We also want this page to allow users to manage the books in the most comfortable way possible. For this, each user has their own library where the purchased books are added. In addition, they can also add books to their wish list to be able to acquire them in the near future.

We also want anyone responsible for maintaining the page to work in the best possible way. For that we want the administrator to have all the information about how the book sale is going on this page. The admin can also add the new titles available on the market, edit the information of an already added book, remove a book from the user's view, etc.

The page will also be the place where users can comment on the books and rate them so that it can be useful to other users in the community.
